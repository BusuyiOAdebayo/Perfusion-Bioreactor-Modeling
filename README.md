Modeling and simulation of TFF- and ATF-based perfusion bioreactors for cell cultivation!

A perfusion bioreactor is an advanced system used for the cultivation and growth of cells, particularly in the field of biotechnology and bioprocessing. It is designed to provide a controlled and continuous flow of nutrients, oxygen, and waste removal to cells cultured within it. This is in contrast to traditional batch bioreactors, where nutrients are added at the start of the culture and waste accumulates until the culture is harvested.

Here's a detailed description of a perfusion bioreactor and how it works:

1. Chamber or Vessel: The perfusion bioreactor typically consists of a chamber or vessel where cells are grown. This chamber can vary in size and design depending on the specific application and scale of cell cultivation.

2. Cell Culture: Inside the chamber, cells are seeded onto a scaffold or substrate. This substrate could be a flat surface, microcarriers, or porous matrices, depending on the type of cells being cultured.

3. Media Reservoir: There is a media reservoir connected to the bioreactor, which holds the growth medium. This growth medium contains essential nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and other compounds necessary for cell growth.

4. Perfusion Pump: A key component of the perfusion bioreactor is a perfusion pump. This pump is responsible for delivering a continuous, controlled flow of fresh growth medium into the chamber where the cells are growing. The flow rate can be adjusted based on the specific requirements of the cell type and culture conditions.

5. Waste Removal: Another crucial function of the perfusion pump is to simultaneously remove spent medium and waste products from the culture chamber. This continuous exchange of medium helps maintain optimal conditions for cell growth by preventing the accumulation of toxic metabolites.

6. Sensors and Monitoring: Perfused bioreactors are equipped with various sensors and monitoring systems. These sensors measure parameters such as pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature, and cell density. This data is used to control and optimize the culture conditions in real-time.

7. Automation and Control: The entire system is often automated and controlled by a computerized system. This allows for precise regulation of flow rates, nutrient concentrations, and other culture parameters.

Advantages of Perfusion Bioreactors:

1. Enhanced Cell Growth: Continuous nutrient supply and waste removal create ideal conditions for cell growth, resulting in higher cell densities and productivity.

2. Reduced Cell Stress: Cells experience less stress due to a more stable environment, which can improve cell viability and product quality.

3. Longer Culture Duration: Perfusion systems enable longer culture durations, reducing the need for frequent harvesting and scaling up production.

4. Efficient Use of Resources: Perfusion reduces the consumption of expensive media and allows for higher cell yields in a smaller bioreactor footprint.

5. Continuous Harvesting: Continuous cell harvesting is possible, which can be essential in applications like antibody production.

Because of the inherent complexities involved in the process and operation of perfusion bioreactor, it becomes essential to use modeling and simulation in its development. Here, we present modeling and simulation of perfusion bioreactor using the three different approaches to modeling and simulation, namely:
1. Mechanistic or first principles or Physics-Based/Driven,
2. Empirical or Data-Based/Driven, and 
3. Hybrid: Physics-Assisted Data-Based and Data-Assisted Physics-Based.
